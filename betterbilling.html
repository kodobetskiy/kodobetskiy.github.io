  <h1>bettER billing</h1>

    <p>
      A lot of Ontario ER doctors have to fill out patient info every shift in order to submit claims for billing. And unlike family doctors, on any given shift, ER doctors could see a huge array of different issues, from broken bokens to diagnostic ultrasounds, to basically anything under the sun!

      I was the only designer on this project, so it was really cool to apply jobs to be done methodology to get a deeper understanding on the billing workflow. It was cool to learn that the main thing doctors need to know is the rules of billing. So most of the app design was just standard components, optimized for clarity and ease of use.

      Taking a look at their current tools, like paper cheat sheets and scribbled notes led us to design functionalty that solves their problems in a   faster way. The main job we had to solve for was helping them find the right code (Search), knowing if it's the right code to use (Code Details) as well as a bunch of little shortcut tools that make their lives easier.

          This was a really cool project where I got to play a role in every piece of marketing, design, strategy in getting both the iOS and Android apps into their respective stores. The coolest thing is working directly with ER physicians and hearing how the app improved their billing.
